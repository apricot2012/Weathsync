# Weathsync

A cross-platform (IOS, Android) mobile app I developed with Xamarin.Forms and Windows forms (mainly in C#) during the 2018 summer.

Syncs weather directly from a REST API I coded and constructed with Microsoft Azure. Focused on also collecting the specific air quality indexes,
such as NO2, NOx, SO2, etc.
